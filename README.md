# Furmark Standalone
  
All Puget Systems builds come with an accessories binder and in the back of that binder you will find our 'Puget Tools' USB. Packed on this USB is a plethora of useful tools. **These tools are bundled into a custom program we created called Diagnostics.** You may find a use for these on your own or your Puget Systems Support Technician may ask that you access them, either way, this guide will provide the details you need.

You should see the following screen. This is an interface that helps launch each of the tools on the USB along with that applications corresponding website if additional information/instructions is needed.
 
This allows quick access to our remote support interface which requires a session key to connect. Your Puget Systems Support Technician will provide the session key during communications then we can connect remotely and help find a solution to whatever problem you're experiencing.

Both options bring you to the same page. 'Launch application' will open your default web browser whereas 'Launch Website' will open in Edge in case you are experiencing issues with your default browser.
 
Core Temp is a compact, no fuss, small footprint, yet powerful program to monitor processor temperature and other vital information. Your Puget Systems Support Technician may ask you to run this for a variety of reasons including:
 
GPU-Z is a lightweight system utility designed to provide vital information about your video card and graphics processor. This application can help diagnose display issues or allow you to monitor a GPU's usage when diagnosing software issues.
 
We recommend running the portable version, but if you wish to install and access more regularly you are welcome to. To use the portable/standalone version simply select 'No' after you click 'Launch Application'.
 
A HDD/SSD utility software which supports standard SATA, USB, Intel/AMD RAID and NVMe. Very robust and useful! It also provides an at-a-glance view of health and temperatures of each detected device. Navigate between the different drives by clicking them in the top left corner.
 
We recommend using the default settings for installation. Once installed FurMark will attempt to update, but we recommend using the version we provided as it seems to be the most stable and functional.
 
Prime95 is a benchmarking/burn-in software designed to **heavily** stress a system. This can help identify issues with RAM, CPUs and power delivery and other components. In a stable system, running Prime95 would not result in crashes or incorrect results. Your Support Technician may advise a different selection, but we generally recommend using the 'blend' test if you are experiencing system instability as it will stress numerous components in an effort to identify a culprit.
 
DriveControllerInfo provides an overview of which drive is attached to which controller driver. It can be helpful when attempting to recognize SSDs and identify HDDs. It also provides serial numbers if needed.
 
Whenever a computer running Windows suddenly reboots without displaying any notice or blue or black screen of death, the first thing that is often thought about is a hardware failure. In reality, crashes are often caused by malfunctioning device drivers and kernel modules. In case of a kernel error, computers running Windows do not show a blue or black screen unless they are configured to do so. Instead, these systems suddenly reboot without any notice.  
  
WhoCrashed shows the drivers that have been crashing your computer with a single click. In most cases it can pinpoint the offending drivers that have been causing misery on your computer system in the past. It does post-mortem crashdump analysis and presents all gathered information in a comprehensible way. In case your system has been crashing because of a hardware failure, WhoCrashed will provide you with guidance to trace the root cause of the problem.
 
BlueScreenView scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes, and displays the information about all crashes in one table. For each crash, BlueScreenView displays the minidump filename, the date/time of the crash, the basic crash information displayed in the blue screen (Bug Check Code and 4 parameters), and the details of the driver or module that possibly caused the crash (filename, product name, file description, and file version).
 
Complete Internet Repair does exactly what it says. It attempts to repair everything internet related, including networking problems. Rely on your Puget Technicians recommendation for which checkboxes to select, depending on your current issue.
 
These tools are extremely useful so having easy access to them will help you diagnose any issues quickly and efficiently. Generally, our Puget Support Technicians will provide all the information needed in order to fully utilize each of these tools so this article is designed as an educational piece. If you end up needing any additional support, please don't hesitate to reach out.
 
Prior to the business end of the review, we take a look at the power consumption numbers and thermal performance of the NUC9i7BEH. The power consumption at the wall was measured with a 4K display being driven through the HDMI port. In the graphs below, we compare the idle and load power of the Intel NUC8i7BEH (Bean Canyon) with other low power PCs evaluated before. For load power consumption, we ran the AIDA64 System Stability Test with various stress components, as well as our custom Prime95 + Furmark stress test, and noted the maximum sustained power consumption at the wall.
 
Our thermal stress routine starts with the system at idle, followed by four stages of different system loading profiles using the AIDA64 System Stability Test (each of 30 minutes duration). In the first stage, we stress the CPU, caches and RAM. In the second stage, we add the GPU to the above list. In the third stage, we stress the GPU standalone. In the final stage, we stress all the system components (including the disks). Beyond this, we leave the unit idle in order to determine how quickly the various temperatures in the system can come back to normal idling range. The various clocks, temperatures and power consumption numbers for the system during the above routine are presented in the graphs below.
 
The system is able to sustain a 28W CPU package power with the core temperature around 90C. The fan is quite noisy in this state, as one may expect. The SSD temperatures are a bit worrisome, pointing to a lack of airflow that could help cool down high-performance NVMe SSDs.
 
Our custom stress test involves running Prime95 in maximum power consumption mode for 30 minutes, followed by both Prime95 and Furmark for 30 minutes. Beyond this, the Prime95 load is taken off, and Furmark alone is left to run for aother 30 minutes. After this, we let the system idle and cool down. The various clocks, temperatures and power consumption numbers for the system during the above routine are presented in the graphs below.
 
The NUC8i7BEH continues Intel's tried and tested incremental improvements scheme for their mid-range NUC line. The move to CFL-U enables a couple of attractive features - high-performance external I/O with an all USB 3.1 Gen 2 configuration, and a 1.73 Gbps 802.11ac 2x2 WLAN chipset. The Bean Canyon NUCs also retain the Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port (introduced to the mid-range NUC family in the NUC7 series) for virtually limitless expansion options. With Thunderbolt 3 having matured, and the availability of various eGFX enclosures, the absence of a discrete GPU in the NUC8i7BEH will hardly be felt. In fact, we had evaluated Powercolor's Gaming Station using the NUC8i7BEH as one of the test platforms, and came away impressed. On the whole, it is almost impossible to find issues with the Bean Canyon NUC from a performance and feature-set perspective.
 
The NUC8i7BEH does have scope for improvement, though. The platform itself is excellent. However, the fan noise / thermal performance is disappointing. It is no doubt challenging to keep a 28W TDP SiP properly cooled in a UCFF machine. Eschewing the UCFF form-factor, and going with a slightly larger case with better airflow could help sustain the higher performance levels of the platform for a longer time. On the feature-set side, Intel would do well to bring dual Thunderbolt 3 ports to their mid-range lineup. Perhaps an additional Thunderbolt 3 controller directly attached to the CPU's PCIe lanes could make the platform look even more attractive. All said, these suggestions should take nothing away from the fact that the NUC8i7BEH is a compact powerhouse. It ticks all the right boxes for multiple use-cases ranging from productivity and office work to HTPC applications.
 
FurMark is a very intensive OpenGL benchmark that uses fur rendering algorithms to measure the performance of graphics cards. Fur rendering is especially adapted to overheat the GPU and that's why FurMark is also a stability and stress test tool (also called GPU burner) for the graphics card.
 
One of the important changes is that FurMark 2 is a command line tool (furmark.exe on Windows and furmark on Linux). The GUI (FurMark\_GUI.exe on Windows and FurMark\_GUI on Linux) is an optional component but it's very handy to quickly launch FurMark 2 and to keep the habits of FurMark 1.
 
FurMark 2 is built with GeeXLab. The GUI is a pure GeeXLab application while the furmark command line tool is built with the GeeXLab SDK. GeeXLab being cross-platform, this first version of FurMark 2 is available for Windows and Linux (the Linux 32-bit version is also available, I will re-compile it for the next update). I plan to release FurMark 2 for Raspberry Pi (I just received my rpi5 board!) and maybe for macOS too.
